				<strong>Ques:</strong>
				What are the tags required to create a navigation list in HTML? 
				<br>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				You would need a &lt;nav&gt; tag and depending on what type of lis you want you would either use a &lt;ul&gt; for unordered list or a &lt;ol&gt; for an ordered list. This webpage is an ordered list as an example. 
			</p>
		</li> 
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Ques:</strong>
				What element is used to create images? Name its attributes.
				<br>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				First you need an &lt;img&gt; tag, and within that you'll need the attributes "src" for the name of the file, and "alt" attrubite for the name of the image and  "width" and "height" attribute to determine its dimentions. Around the &lt;img&gt; tag there is a &lt;figure&gt; tag and before the &lt;figure&gt; tag closes you should put a &lt;figcaption&gt; for the caption you want under your photo.

			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Identify the odd one from these tags: &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;td&gt; and state the reason.
				<br>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				The &lt;b&gt; tag is the odd one out in this group of tags. Both &lt;tr&gt; and &lt;td&gt; are elements attached to a table tag in HTML. &lt;b&gt; is a tag used to bold lettering to show imprtance. For example: <b>This is Important Information.</b>

				<strong>Ques:</strong>
				Give an example of color picker input. 
				<br>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>				
				What I did was crate an input tag ( &lt;input&gt;) and in the "type" option I put "color" and in the name I put the color code that I wanted. In this case I want black so I will se the number at <i>#0000</i>. <input type="color" name="#0000"> 
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Ques:</strong>
				What is the use of name and value attributes? Give two examples. 
				<br>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>				
				  Value attribute specifies the initial value of an element such as buttons or input. An example of "value" being used is in our third assignment.
			</p>
			<div id="email-container" class="form-elm">
				<label for="email" Your JOTM account</label>
				<input type="email" name="email" id="email" value="yourname@Jellymail.com">
			</div>
			<p>
				In this example, the value is the place holder in the box until someone fills in the box with their own information.
				Name attributes are used to specify or "name" elements of code, so the CSS file can identify and modify the content. An example of using the "name" attribute is when inputting an image you have to add a name to the file. This helps the CSS identify but also veiwers of the code identify what is in the img file.

				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				How would you link an external style sheet? Give example. 
				<br>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				First thing you have to do is make your CSS file. To do that, simply create a new file and save it as <i> style.css </i> and add the appropriate code to your liking. After you create a CSS file, you have to add a link tag that would look something like this <br> &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/style.css"&gt; (example taken from assignment 4).
